# CSE-305-PS5

# Running the webapp
* first - open apache server and mysql database
* second- run the ps5.sql script which creates all the database called rynps5
* then go the folder where all the php scripts exist and run the "styledFindSpec.php" file that has the main page for the web app

# ON windows 10
   runninng the php script from local host on port 8080- make sure ur appache is running in this port
   if not quick fix would be to go the log file in the xampp near appache button and change all the port occurrances to 8080:
        by default the port in the log file is 80 but if you have skype or other websites running in this port, you might not be able to    connect since the port is already taken
        otherwise change the url below to confirm with the port by which your apache server is running
        
 "http://localhost:8080/PS%205/styledFindSpec.php"
 
 The above will lead you to the Home page of the webapp
 * click "PC" on the nav bar - for problem 1 solution
                 * "desiredPC_Price.php "- is another script related to problem one no need to run since it gets called on click of PC same applies to other *
* click "Laptop" on the nav bar - for problem 2 solution
                 * "desiredLaptop.php" - script related to this problem *
